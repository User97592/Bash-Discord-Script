# Bash-Discord-Script
Hello there.

My name is Taylor and until today I had an issue.

I'm on Linux Mint 22.1, and I had installed Discord as a flatpak from the software manager.
I then started to play games that take up the full screen.
I often wanted to open discord, but had to close out the game, open it from my desktop and then open the game again.

I tried using the terminal but that also failed.
Hence, me making a bash script.
